Exercise 1: DVD Club Points
A Video club that awards points to its customers based on the number of videos purchased each month. The points are awarded as follows:
• If a customer purchases 0 dvd’s, the earning is 0 points.
• If a customer purchases 1 dvd, the earning is 5 points.
• If a customer purchases 2 dvd’s,the earning is 15 points.
• If a customer purchases 3 dvd’s, the earning is 30 points.
• If a customer purchases 4 or more dvd’s, the earning is 60 points.
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of videos that he or she has purchased this month, then displays the number of points awarded.

Exercise 2: BMI
Write a program that calculates the BMI ( Body Mass Index ) for a user.
Let the program ask the user for needed input:
• the weight ( in kg )
• the height ( in meter )
Then, display the BMI value on the screen with a message. The message depends on the BMI index, if the person is:
- underweight
- normal weight
- overweight
or
- has obesity
BMI index
Under weight: < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 - 24.99
Over weight: 25.0 - 29.99
Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater
Formula: BMI = weight / (height2
)

Exercise 3: Property Tax
A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent of the property’s actual value. For example, if an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then 72¢ for each $100 of the assessment value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $43.20. Write a program that asks for the actual value of a piece of property and displays the assessment value and property tax.

Exercise 4: Sum of Numbers
Write a program using a while loop and within the loop asks the user to enter a series of positive numbers. The user should enter a negative number to signal the end of the series. After all the positive numbers have been entered, the program should display
their sum.

Exercise 5: Maximum of Two Values
Write a function named my_max that accepts two integer values as arguments and returns the value that is the greater of the two. For example, if 12 and 19
are passed as arguments to the function, the function should return 19. Use the function in a program that prompts the user to enter two integer values.
The program should display the value that is the greater of the two.

Exercise 6: Test Average and Grade
Write a program that asks the user to enter five test scores. The program should display a letter grade for each score and the average test score. Write the following functions in the program:
• calc_average This function should accept five test scores as arguments
and return the average of the scores.
• determine_grade This function should accept a test score as an argument and return a letter grade for the score based on the following grading scale:
Score Letter Grade
90-100 A
80-89 B
70-79 C
60-69 D
Below 60 F
